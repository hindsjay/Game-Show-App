# Treehouse Techdegree - Project 6 - Game Show App

For this project we were tasked to create a word guessing game.  The player will click on a letter and if the letter is in the phrase it will appear.  If not, the player loses a "chance".  The player has 5 chances to guess all the letters in the phrase.

The main HTML markup and CSS styling were provided.  Main focus for this project was DOM manipulation using JavaScript.  We were required to write the appropriate JavaScript code from scratch.  

I decided to make this a little more personal by making the game about NBA (baseketball) teams.
